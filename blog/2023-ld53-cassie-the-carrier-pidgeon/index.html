<p>I decided to participate in <a href="https://ldjam.com">Ludum Dare</a> this year. Ludum Dare is a biannual game jam, where you create a game catering to a theme that is announced when the jam starts. There are several categories, but I decided to participate in the &quot;compo&quot;, the competition, where you create a game from scratch, by yourself, in 48 hours.</p>
<p>This years theme was <em>delivery</em>. I had some trouble coming up with ideas that felt fun and fit the theme, but after some tinkering I landed on my final idea: A pidgeon that needs to deliver packages in a village. That village is under attack by monsters, so you need to protect yourself with a gun. The more points you score, the more monsters will spawn, forcing you to be careful and also upgrade your weapon.</p>
<p>I can now proudly present: Cassie, the carrier pidgeon. <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53/cassie-the-carrier-pidgeon">Download from Ludum Dare</a>.</p>

<p>Developing a game from scratch in such a small amount of time is challenging. There's so many parts needed to make a playable game that you really need to focus on a tiny amount of features to complete it. To give you a rough idea of how I spent my weekend:</p>
<ul>
<li>I came up with an idea.</li>
<li>I implemented basic character controls and shooting.</li>
<li>I added monsters you can shoot.</li>
<li>I drew placeholder graphics.</li>
<li>I added jobs so you can pick up packages.</li>
<li>I added houses you deliver the packages to.</li>
<li>I randomized house positions because I was too lazy to do proper level design.</li>
<li>I added health you can lose when you're attacked.</li>
<li>I added a game over screen.</li>
<li>I added a menu screen.</li>
<li>I tweaked the spawning behavior of monsters.</li>
<li>I added upgradable shooting cooldown.</li>
<li>I fixed weird bugs when switching between menu and game.</li>
<li>I added a system for jobs with varying difficulty.</li>
<li>I added an auto fire upgrade for the gun.</li>
<li>I tweaked the spawning behavior of monsters (again).</li>
<li>I made some background music.</li>
<li>I drew prettier graphics.</li>
<li>I fixed some bugs of the weapon upgrades and the player's walking speed.</li>
<li>I added explosion effects and sound effects.</li>
<li>I tweaked the spawning behavior of monsters (<em>again</em>).</li>
<li>And finally I exported the game and tested it a bit more.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's so much stuff! And that does not even include all the fun ideas I had for different weapon types, more enemy types, different maps and so on. I really thought that I could at least implement different bullet types, but that was reduced to being able to upgrade your shooting speed.</p>
<p>Drawing graphics was also interesting, since I'm not really that great at it. This is what the game looked like while I was still prototyping:</p>
<p><img src="https://haselkern.com/blog/2023-ld53-cassie-the-carrier-pidgeon/dev02.png" alt="Crude pixel art with a horrible color palette and very basic characters" /></p>
<p>All the things are there, but you would probably be a bit more into it if the game looked nice. I turned to <a href="https://lospec.com">lospec.com</a>, a great resource for things about pixel art, and decided to go with the <a href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/nyx8">Nyx8</a> color palette to give my game a makeover. Limiting myself to a few colors to choose from does not guarantee that the game will look nice, but reduces the number of artistic crimes I am able to commit. This is the game after I redrew everything:</p>

<p>Doing all the things above in only 48 hours was definitely stressful. I had a lot of fun and now can brag about a new game, but I underestimated how much the limited time influenced the amount of fun I had. The jam felt less like a fun weekend activity and more like an extended work week.</p>
<p><a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53/cassie-the-carrier-pidgeon">Download the game from the  Ludum Dare website</a> if you want to try it out and maybe leave a little feedback there if you like.</p>
<hr />
<p>A few days after the jam <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53/popcorn-odyssey/i-made-a-little-art-for-some-of-my-favorite-games-in-this-jam">0X_VOID_X0 made some awesome fanart</a> of their favorite games which I just had to share. Thank you!</p>
