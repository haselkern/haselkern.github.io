      <description>I decided to participate in Ludum Dare this year. Ludum Dare is a biannual game jam, where you create a game catering to a theme that is announced when the jam starts. There are several categories, but I decided to participate in the &amp;ldquo;compo&amp;rdquo;, the competition, where you create a game from scratch, by yourself, in 48 hours.
This years theme was delivery. I had some trouble coming up with ideas that felt fun and fit the theme, but after some tinkering I landed on my final idea: A pidgeon that needs to deliver packages in a village.</description>

      <description>Fly through space and try not to crash! A game for Android where your goal is to collect coins.
I used Unity a lot for prototyping smaller games, but always wanted to try Godot. This game is the result of me playing around with it over the course of a weekend.
I made most of this game over the course of a weekend and added more features over time.</description>
